```js
var connect = require('connect');
var resaveSass = require('resave-sass');
var serveStatic = require('serve-static');

var app = connect();

app.use(serveStatic('./public'));
app.use(resaveSass({
    bundles: {
        '/main.css': './source/main.scss'
    },
    savePath: './public'
}));

app.listen(3000);

Install
-------

Install Resave Sass with [npm][npm]:

```sh
npm install resave-sass
```


Getting Started
---------------

Require in Resave Sass:

```js
var resaveSass = require('resave-sass');
```

Use the created middleware in your application:

```js
var connect = require('connect');

var app = connect();

app.use(resaveSass({
    bundles: {
        '/main.css': './source/main.scss'
    }
}));
```

In the example above, requests to `/main.css` will load the file `./source/main.scss`, run it through Sass, and serve it up.

This isn't great in production environments as it can be quite slow. In these cases you can save the output to a file which will get served by another middleware:

```js
var connect = require('connect');
var serveStatic = require('serve-static');

var app = connect();

app.use(serveStatic('./public'));

app.use(resaveSass({
    bundles: {
        '/main.css': './source/main.scss'
    },
    savePath: './public'
}));
```

In the example above the first time `/main.css` is requested it will get compiled and saved into `public/main.css`. On the next request, the `serve-static` middleware will find the created file and serve it up with proper caching etc.


Options
-------

#### `basePath` (string)

The directory to look for bundle files in. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.

#### `sass` (object)

A configuration object which will get passed into Sass. See the [Sass options documentation][sass-opts] for more information.

If `NODE_ENV` is `'production'`, it defaults to:

```js
{
    sourceMap: false,
    sourceMapEmbed: false,
    sourceMapContents: false
}
```

If `NODE_ENV` is *not* `'production'`, it defaults to:

```js
{
    sourceMap: true,
    sourceMapEmbed: true,
    sourceMapContents: true
}
```

#### `bundles` (object)

A map of bundle URLs and source paths. The source paths are relative to the `basePath` option. In the following example requests to `/foo.css` will load, compile and serve `source/foo.scss`:

```js
app.use(resaveSass({
    basePath: 'source'
    bundles: {
        '/foo.js': 'foo.scss'
    }
}));
```

#### `log` (object)

An object which implments the methods `error` and `info` which will be used to report errors and information.

```js
app.use(resaveSass({
    log: console
}));
```

#### `savePath` (string)

The directory to save bundled files to. This is optional, but is recommended in production environments. This should point to a directory which is also served by your application. Defaults to `null`.

Example of saving bundles only in production:

```js
app.use(resaveSass({
    savePath: (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? './public' : null)
}));
```


Examples
--------

### Basic Example

Bundle some Sass files together and serve them up.
